# even or odd via bitwise AND operator.

# i/p: 10
# o/p: Even number

# the bitwise AND operator operates on one bit at a time
# since all the even numbers have 0 as their last bit, operating the number and 1 with bitwise AND will give 0 as output
# hence the else statement will execute giving output as "Even number"

number=10
if number&1:
  print('Odd number')
else:
  print('Even number')
